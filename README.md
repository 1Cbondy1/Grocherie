## Overview
Grochérie is a web app that allows multiple users to view, edit, and complete shopping lists shared across devices. It's geared towards roommates, families, offices, or any groups of people that shop together. 

Actions performed are updated in real-time without having to refresh the app. Once lists are created, they can only be accessed by users with whom they have been shared. A single list may have multiple users, and a single user may have multiple lists.

By hosting collaborative lists in a central digital location, Grocherie saves time and headaches by minimizing miscommunications and allows a single person to shop for everyone on their shared lists at once.
